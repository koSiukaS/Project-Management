Make tables
Make tables from the parts we have. We already have table parts now we need to make sure the tables are built and ready for transportation. But first we need to varnish it after that we need to lacquer it two times. If that is done, than we can start constructing a table. We use screws and glue for that. After that is done, we load it in boxes and transport it.
