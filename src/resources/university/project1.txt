Creating a Board Game
You are a board game manufacturer, and you have been assigned the task of creating a board game that will help students review everything they read in a fun and interesting way! The game has to have cards with questions. It can't be boring, so make it as colorful as you can. And make not one set of rules so as to different age groups could play.
