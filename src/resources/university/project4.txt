Make table parts
Make table parts from an oak tree. You have to make sure you have made table parts perfect because in the next project we will use them. So at the start you have to make a plan what you'll need and then make a sketch. After that, go to work you have to make it the right size and the right smoothness. Also, don't forget sanding the wood is very important. And for the end make screw holes. After that, give it to the other workers to construct it.
