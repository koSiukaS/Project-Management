E-Shop of Clothes and Accessories
Some brands have shops in the shopping centers and e-shops. Thus, things can be bought online using cards and at the shop using cash. Also, the number of clothes and accessories is limited. If someone buys a pair of trousers of some type and size, it might be that another person would not get it. But the system should inform where to search for the necessary thing, another shop, another city, etc. Clothes have a lot of properties, e.g. size, color, type, model. If the use does not get what is needed the system should suggest to try another model of the same size (if this particle is at the shop, of course).
