Grow an eucalyptus
Grow an eucalyptus tree as soon as possible. Take care of it. You have to water it, fertilize it and even use pesticides. Don't forget to prune branches for better grow to.For it to grow big and strong don't forget to talk with it sometimes too. Because it is eucalyptus it will grow very fast so be ready in a year or two to see it become very large. The only problem is that it will be hard to destroy it after it is so big.
